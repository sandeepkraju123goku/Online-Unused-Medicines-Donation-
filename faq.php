          <button class="accordion">1. Can individuals donate? What if I have extra medicine in my medicine cabinet?</button>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Returning and donating are not exclusive, just donate the medicine you are not getting credit for. When looking at their credit statement, many organizations find that most of their medication is not creditable and can save more money with potential tax deductions than they currently get in credit.</p>
